Spatial domain abstractions for spatio-temporal Hawkes processes.

Each domain defines how distances are measured, how coordinates are wrapped to
stay within the domain, and how to sample uniformly from the domain.

:class:`Circle` and :class:`Torus2D` write out one quotient each by hand, and
:class:`Sphere` writes out the one closed surface that is *not* a quotient --
it is simply connected, so a deck group is the wrong tool for it.
:class:`FundamentalDomain` is the general construction: a convex geodesic
polygon in a constant-curvature model space, glued to itself along its
boundary. Together with the three model spaces in
:mod:`~hawkes_package.spatio_temporal._model` it reaches **every closed
surface** -- orientable or not, of any genus.

Which model space a surface needs is not a choice. By uniformisation the sign
of the Euler characteristic fixes it:

=================  =========================  ==========  ==========================
:math:`\chi`       surface                    geometry    built by
=================  =========================  ==========  ==========================
:math:`> 0`        :math:`S^2`                spherical   :class:`Sphere`

:math:`= 0`        Klein bottle               flat        ``klein_bottle()``

:math:`< 0`        :math:`N_k`, :math:`k > 2`  hyperbolic  ``crosscaps(k)``
=================  =========================  ==========  ==========================

The last four are classmethods of :class:`FundamentalDomain`.

Gauss-Bonnet, :math:`\int K\,dA = 2\pi\chi`, is what ties the three columns
together, and every :class:`FundamentalDomain` checks it at construction.

    """Abstract base class for spatial domains.

    The spatial integral is a quadrature rule over :attr:`bounds`, restricted to
    the nodes :meth:`contains` admits and weighted by :meth:`volume_element`.
    Subclasses must therefore satisfy

    ``volume == integral of volume_element over {x in bounds : contains(x)}``.

    The optional hooks default to "the domain fills its bounding box, with the
    flat chart measure", which reduces that requirement to the older
    ``volume == prod(bounds widths)`` and leaves an existing subclass — which
    overrides none of them — behaving exactly as before.

    radius : float
        Sphere radius. The area is :math:`4\pi R^2` and the curvature
        :math:`1/R^2`.

    Notes
    -----
    Two properties of the chart are worth knowing rather than fixing.

    The chart is **singular at the poles**, where the area element vanishes and
    all longitudes name the same point. That costs nothing: the poles are a
    measure-zero set, Gauss-Legendre nodes are strictly interior to their panels
    so none of them lands on one, and every geometric predicate runs in ambient
    coordinates.

    The chart is **seamed at** :math:`\varphi = \pm\pi`, and :attr:`periodic` is
    ``False``, so a Metropolis proposal across the seam is rejected rather than
    folded. The chain therefore mixes slowly near the seam. Folding would be
    reversible here — longitude really is periodic — but it is not reversible in
    colatitude, and a half-folded proposal is not a symmetric move; correctness
    first, mixing second, as for :class:`FundamentalDomain`.

    :attr:`topology` reports the orientability, Euler characteristic and genus
    that result. :class:`Torus2D` is the rectangle case, available here as
    :meth:`rectangle`; :meth:`hexagon`, :meth:`klein_bottle`,
    :meth:`projective_plane`, :meth:`genus` and :meth:`crosscaps` between them
    reach every closed surface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices : array_like, shape (n, 2)
        Polygon corners in order, either winding, in the model space's chart
        coordinates. Must be convex.
    pairings : sequence of array_like
        Side-pairing isometries as ``3x3`` (or ``2x3``) ambient matrices. Each
        must be an isometry of `model` and must act freely. They need not be the
        individual side pairings — they need only *generate* the group, as the
        hexagonal torus's two translations generate its three side pairings.
    n_images : int, optional
        Deprecated. Word length the deck group used to be truncated at for
        :meth:`distance`. Truncation is now by displacement radius and
        certified per call, so the value is used only by :meth:`orbit`.

        .. deprecated:: 0.4.0
           Removed in 0.5.0. Pass nothing; :meth:`orbit` still takes its own
           ``n_images``.
    model : ModelSpace, optional
        The geometry the polygon lives in. Defaults to the Euclidean plane.
    interior : array_like, optional
        A chart point strictly inside the polygon, used to orient the edge
        half-spaces and as the centre of the Dirichlet reduction. Defaults to
        the geodesic centroid of the vertices, which is inside any convex
        polygon that does not surround the whole model space. The hemisphere
        presenting :math:`\mathbb{RP}^2` is the case that needs it explicitly:
        its four corners lie on one great circle and average to the centre of
        the sphere.

    Attributes
    ----------
    topology : hawkes_package.spatio_temporal._gluing.Topology
        Orientability, Euler characteristic, genus and name of the quotient.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the polygon is not convex, if a pairing is not a free isometry, if
        some side is left unpaired, if a corner cycle does not close up with an
        angle sum of :math:`2\pi`, or if Gauss-Bonnet is violated.

    Notes
    -----
    :attr:`periodic` is ``False``, so MCMC proposals leaving the polygon are
    *rejected* rather than folded back through :meth:`wrap`. Folding is
    reversible only when the group acts by translations, which leave a Gaussian
    proposal invariant; that holds for the flat orientable presentations and for
    nothing else, and this package has a history of bounds and samplers that
    were wrong silently rather than loudly.

    .. versionadded:: 0.3.0

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
       Orientation-reversing pairings are accepted, so the presentation reaches
       non-orientable surfaces. In exchange, three conditions that were
       previously unchecked are enforced at construction: freeness of every
       pairing, a complete side correspondence, and Poincare's angle-sum
       condition on every corner cycle.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
       Takes a `model`, so the polygon may be spherical or hyperbolic rather
       than only flat.

    `word` gives one ``(label, sign)`` per side, in order, and each label appears
    twice. Two sides with **opposite** signs are glued head to tail -- the
    orientable case, :math:`a \ldots a^{-1}` -- and two with the **same** sign
    are glued head to head, which is a crosscap and reverses orientation.

    Each correspondence is realised by exactly two isometries, one of each
    orientation, and only one of them is a side pairing: the other maps the
    polygon onto *itself* rather than onto the neighbouring copy, and it is
    always the rotation or reflection that would quotient to an orbifold. They
    are told apart by where the outward normal goes -- a side pairing must send
    the outward normal of its source side to the *inward* normal of its target,
    since the image of the polygon lies on the far side.
