class SpatioTemporalHawkesProcess(HawkesProcess):
    """Spatio-temporal Hawkes process on an arbitrary :class:`SpatialDomain`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base : callable
        Background intensity ``mu(x)`` as a function of spatial coordinate.
    spatial : callable
        Isotropic spatial kernel evaluated at a non-negative distance.
    temporal : callable
        Temporal kernel evaluated at a non-negative time lag.
    domain : SpatialDomain, optional
        Spatial domain. Defaults to the unit :class:`Circle`.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
           May be a proper subset of its bounding box: the quadrature rule is
           masked by :meth:`~hawkes_package.SpatialDomain.contains` and weighted
           by :meth:`~hawkes_package.SpatialDomain.volume_element`, and the
           location sampler targets the intensity restricted to the domain
           rather than to the box. Before 0.3.0 a domain whose ``volume``
           differed from ``prod(bounds widths)`` raised :class:`ValueError`;
           the summed quadrature weights are now checked against ``volume``
           instead, warning above 1% apart and raising above 10%.
    monotone_temporal_kernel : bool
        Set ``True`` when `temporal` is monotone decreasing. This permits a
        tighter thinning bound and skips the numerical search for the kernel's
        maximum.
    rng : None, int or numpy.random.Generator
        Source of randomness. See :class:`~hawkes_package.base.HawkesProcess`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.2.0

    Attributes
    ----------
    events : numpy.ndarray
        Shape ``(ndim + 1, n)``. Row 0 holds event times, rows 1.. hold
        coordinates.

        subset of it needs the chain confined to the domain itself. Folding the
        sample back afterwards is not the same thing and is not correct:
        `_full_intensity` off the domain is the periodic extension, so the box
        covers some parts of the domain twice and others once, and folding a
        box-distributed draw inherits that unevenness. Returning zero is the
        confinement -- :func:`~hawkes_package.mcmc.mcmc_sampler` already treats
        a zero density as a rejection, and rejection (rather than folding) is
        what keeps the chain reversible for a general pairing group.

        **The measure.** The event location is distributed as
        :math:`\lambda\,\mathrm{d}A` on the surface, but the sampler walks in
        *chart* coordinates with a symmetric Gaussian proposal and accepts on
        the raw ratio, so the density it must be handed is
        :math:`\lambda \cdot \sqrt{\det g}` -- the same
        :meth:`~hawkes_package.SpatialDomain.volume_element` factor
        :func:`~hawkes_package.spatio_temporal._integration.restrict` applies to
        the quadrature weights. Omitting it biases the sampled locations towards
        wherever the chart compresses area, by exactly the factor the chart
        compresses by: on the sphere it would pile events at the poles.

        For a domain that fills its box with the flat measure -- every domain
        that predates 0.4.0 -- ``contains`` is constantly ``True``,
