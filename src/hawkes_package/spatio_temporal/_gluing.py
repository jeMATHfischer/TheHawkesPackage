r"""Side pairings, vertex cycles and the topology they determine.

A polygon plus a set of side-pairing isometries is a *presentation*, and a
presentation is a surface only if it satisfies Poincare's polygon theorem: the
pairings must carry each side onto another side, and walking the corners of the
polygon through those pairings must close up with an angle sum of exactly
:math:`2\pi` and a trivial cycle transformation. Anything else glues to
something that is not a closed surface -- most commonly an *orbifold*, where the
angle sum is :math:`2\pi/m` and the quotient has a cone point.

Nothing downstream notices the difference. The Ogata loop, the quadrature and
the location sampler all run happily on an orbifold presentation and produce a
process on the wrong space, so the checks here are made **at construction**,
where the caller can still act on them. That replaces the older behaviour, in
which a bad presentation surfaced -- if at all -- as a
:class:`ValueError` from :meth:`~hawkes_package.FundamentalDomain.wrap`, deep
inside a simulation and long after the mistake.

Three things live here:

* :func:`group_window` and :func:`window_by_radius`, the two truncations of the
  deck group. Word length is a heuristic; displacement radius is a *bound*, and
  :meth:`~hawkes_package.FundamentalDomain.distance` uses it for that reason.
* :func:`infer_pairing`, which recovers which side goes to which. The pairings
  a caller supplies generate the group but need not be the individual side
  pairings -- the hexagonal torus has three pairs of sides and only two
  generators -- so the search runs over a group window rather than over the
  generators alone.
* :func:`vertex_cycles` and :func:`topology`, the corner walk and the
  Euler characteristic, orientability and genus read off from it.

    r"""Deduplicate deck elements by where they send one reference point.

    Two group elements agreeing on a single point differ by something fixing
    that point, and a side-pairing group acts freely, so agreeing on one point
    means being the same element. That makes the image of the polygon's centre
    a complete fingerprint -- and a far better behaved one than the matrix.

    Two other keys were tried, and both fail the same way, for the same reason,
    at different depths.

    *The matrix*, rounded to fixed decimals, deduplicates up to about ten
    letters. Beyond that a hyperbolic word's entries have grown to
    :math:`\cosh R`, its rounding error has grown with them, two spellings of
    one element round to different keys, and the search stops converging: it ran
    to convergence at word length 8 and re-exploded at 11, growing without bound
    over a group with a few thousand elements in the ball being searched.

    *The chart* fails sooner and more quietly. The Poincare disc crowds the
    whole of infinity into a unit circle, so the images of distinct elements at
    radius :math:`R` sit :math:`O(e^{-R})` apart in it, and by word length five
    on a genus-2 surface that is already comparable to any fixed tolerance --
    the two keys disagree on the size of that ball. A key that is losing
    resolution can merge distinct elements as easily as split one, and merging
    is the direction that fails silently: the window comes back short and the
    quotient metric returns a distance that is too large, which reads as a
    kernel that has already decayed.

    The *ambient direction* -- the image point divided by its Euclidean norm --
    has neither problem. Distinct copies stay a bounded Minkowski chord apart
    however far out they go, so dividing by a norm that grows with them leaves
    the separation comfortably above rounding.

    Lookup is by grid bucket rather than by exact key, so a point sitting on a
    rounding boundary still matches its neighbour.

    :meth:`~hawkes_package.FundamentalDomain.distance` that turns a heuristic
    into a theorem — see the note there for the radius that suffices.

    The search expands every element within ``radius + slack`` and keeps every
    element within `radius`. The slack is what makes it complete rather than
    merely plausible. The copies of the polygon tile the model space, so the
    geodesic from ``centre`` to ``g.centre`` crosses a chain of copies, each
    adjacent to the next and therefore differing from it by a single generator.
    Every copy in that chain contains a point of the geodesic, so within
    `radius` of ``centre``, and its own centre is within a circumradius of any
    of its points. Passing the polygon's circumradius as `slack` therefore
    reaches every such ``g``, and stopping the expansion outside it drops
    nothing.

    In a hyperbolic geometry that margin is not a formality: the element count
    grows like :math:`e^R`, so an over-generous slack is the difference between
    a few hundred elements and a few million.

    One step crosses side ``e`` of the current copy. The copy on the other side
    of ``e`` is ``forward[e]**-1`` applied to the polygon, so the accumulated
    isometry right-multiplies by that inverse; the corner the walk is turning
    about is unmoved, so in the new copy's own coordinates it is the vertex
    ``forward[e]`` sends the old one to; and the next side to cross is the other

    the flag it started from.

    Two quantities come out. The **angle sum** must be :math:`2\pi`: the copies
    around the point must close up exactly once. The **cycle transformation**
    must be the identity: closing up geometrically is not enough if the group

    the sides are glued in pairs -- and one vertex per corner cycle, so
    :math:`\chi = V - E + F` is immediate. Genus follows from
