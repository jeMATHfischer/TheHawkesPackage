    r"""Return a periodised version of `kernel_fn` that sums over image points.

    For a domain with discrete translational symmetry (:class:`Circle`,
    :class:`Torus2D`) the true kernel between ``x`` and ``y`` is

    .. math::

        K(x, y) = \sum_{\text{offset} \in \text{images}}
                  \mathrm{kernel\_fn}\!\left( \| x - y - \text{offset} \| \right).

    With ``n_images=3`` the sum covers offsets up to three periods in each
    direction, which is ample for a rapidly decaying kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel_fn : callable
        Isotropic kernel evaluated at a non-negative scalar distance.
    domain : SpatialDomain
        The domain whose periodicity structure to respect. :class:`Circle` and
        :class:`Torus2D` carry hand-written lattices; any other domain that
        declares a deck group through :meth:`~hawkes_package.SpatialDomain.orbit`
        — as :class:`~hawkes_package.FundamentalDomain` does — is periodised by
        summing over that orbit. A domain with no deck group falls back to a single evaluation at
        ``domain.distance(x, y)``.
    n_images : int
        Number of image periods in each direction.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        The periodised kernel, taking two domain points.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
       The ``orbit`` branch was added. Before 0.3.0 only :class:`Circle` and
       :class:`Torus2D` were recognised and every other domain received the
       unperiodised kernel — which, wherever the kernel has not decayed by the
       boundary, is a different process rather than a coarser one.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> kernel = make_periodic(lambda d: np.exp(-(d**2)), Circle())
    >>> round(kernel(0.3, -1.2), 6)

    r"""Warn if the image sum is truncated somewhere the kernel has not decayed.

    Periodising by summing over a truncated orbit is only an approximation to
    the true sum, and how good an approximation depends on a race between the
    kernel's decay and the deck group's growth. In a flat geometry the group
    grows polynomially and any ordinary kernel wins the race comfortably. In a
    **hyperbolic** one the number of deck elements at distance :math:`R` grows
    like :math:`e^{R}`, so the tail beyond the window is of order
    :math:`e^{R} \sup_{d > R} \kappa_s(d)` and converges only for a kernel
    decaying faster than :math:`e^{-d}`. A Gaussian qualifies; an exponential
    with rate above one qualifies; a power law does not, and nothing about a
    power law announces that it does not.

    So the diagnostic is the same shape as
    :func:`~hawkes_package.spatio_temporal._integration.check_resolution`:
    compare what one more ring of images adds against what the sum already
    holds. A last ring worth more than `rtol` of the total means the sum has
    been cut where the kernel is still contributing, and the simulated
    excitation is smaller than the model asks for -- which, since the location
    sampler and the thinning bound both use it, is not a visible error but a
    quietly different process.

    Deterministic, and evaluated once at construction rather than on every one
    of the hundreds of thousands of kernel evaluations a simulation runs.
