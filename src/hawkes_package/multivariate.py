"""Multivariate Hawkes processes: several event types exciting one another.

One kernel shape and a matrix of scales, rather than one independently
parameterised kernel per ordered pair. That is a modelling restriction --
every cross-excitation decays at the same rate -- and it buys three things
worth the trade: the matrix stays out of every kernel evaluation, the parameter
count is ``d**2 + d`` rather than ``d**2`` kernels, and the likelihood built on
this in :mod:`hawkes_package.inference` keeps a per-type recursion that is
``O(n d)`` rather than ``O(n d**2)``.

    r"""Mutually exciting Hawkes process over a finite set of event types.

    The conditional intensity of type *i* is

    .. math::

        \lambda_i(t \mid H_t) = \varphi\!\left( \mu_i + \sum_j A_{ij}
            \sum_{t_k < t,\; c_k = j} \kappa(t - t_k) \right),

    with one shared kernel :math:`\kappa`, a non-negative excitation matrix
    :math:`A`, a background rate per type, and a monotone-increasing
    :math:`\varphi` applied elementwise.

    One class covers both bound regimes, as
    :class:`~hawkes_package.spatio_temporal.process.SpatioTemporalHawkesProcess`
    does: pass ``monotone_temporal_kernel=False`` for a kernel that rises before
    it decays, and each event is then bounded by its own future supremum rather
    than by its current value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu : array_like of shape (d,)
        Background rate per type. Non-negative.
    excitation : array_like of shape (d, d)
        ``A[i, j]`` scales the excitation type *j* exerts on type *i*.
        **Non-negative**, and refused otherwise: see
        :class:`~hawkes_package.base.MultivariateTemporalHawkesProcess` for why
        that is the bound argument rather than a modelling preference.
    temporal : callable
        The shared kernel :math:`\kappa`, taking a non-negative lag. It must
        accept a NumPy array and return one elementwise.
    nonlinearity : callable, optional
        The monotone-increasing :math:`\varphi`, applied elementwise. Defaults
        to the identity, which is the linear Hawkes process.
    monotone_temporal_kernel : bool
        Whether `temporal` decreases everywhere. ``False`` selects the
        bell-shaped bound.
    peak_lag, peak_value : float, optional
        Lag at which `temporal` peaks and its value there, used only when
        `monotone_temporal_kernel` is ``False``. Supply them to skip the
        numerical search.
    rng : None, int or numpy.random.Generator
        Source of randomness. See :class:`~hawkes_package.base.HawkesProcess`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `mu` is not one-dimensional or carries a negative entry, if
        `excitation` is not square, not the same size as `mu`, or carries a
        negative entry.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> process = MultivariateHawkes(
    ...     mu=[0.4, 0.2],
    ...     excitation=[[0.3, 0.1], [0.5, 0.2]],

    exactly at one type: ``MultivariateExponentialHawkes([mu], [[alpha]], beta)``
    and ``ExponentialHawkes([mu, alpha, beta])`` consume the same stream and
    produce the same events.

    **One decay rate for every pair.** :math:`\beta` is a scalar, so
    cross-excitation between different pairs of types cannot decay at different
    speeds. That is the price of one kernel shape with a matrix of scales, and
    it is what keeps the parameter count at :math:`d^2 + d + 1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu : array_like of shape (d,)
        Background rate per type. Non-negative.
    excitation : array_like of shape (d, d)
        ``A[i, j]`` is the excitation type *j* exerts on type *i*. Non-negative.
    beta : float
        Shared decay rate. Positive.
    rng : None, int or numpy.random.Generator
        Source of randomness. See :class:`~hawkes_package.base.HawkesProcess`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``beta <= 0``, if `mu` or `excitation` carries a negative entry, if
        `excitation` is not square or not the size of `mu`, or if the spectral
        radius of ``excitation / beta`` is at or above one. The last is the
        stationarity condition: the kernel has mass ``1 / beta``, so
        ``excitation / beta`` is the branching matrix, and at or above one each
