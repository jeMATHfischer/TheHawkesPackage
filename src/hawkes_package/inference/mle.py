r"""Maximum likelihood, beside the sequential machinery rather than instead of it.

The package's position is that the sequential Monte Carlo path is the recommended
one: it reports a posterior, it absorbs data in blocks, and its diagnostics say
when it has failed. This module exists for two things that position cannot
supply. A reviewer comparing point-process libraries runs a maximum-likelihood
fit, and "we do SMC instead" is not an answer they can check. And a mode is a
good place to centre an initial cloud, which
:func:`~hawkes_package.inference.mle.warm_start_proposal` turns into a real saving.

**SciPy is used here, and that widens a stated rule.** Runtime dependencies are
still numpy and scipy only, but until 0.10.0 scipy was held to a single call
site -- ``minimize_scalar`` in :mod:`hawkes_package._numerics` -- which is why
:func:`~hawkes_package.inference.diagnostics.ks_exponential` hand-rolls the
Kolmogorov series and :mod:`hawkes_package.inference.priors` hand-writes its
marginals. The rule is now that scipy is reached for where a hand-written version
would be *worse*, not wherever it is convenient. An optimiser is squarely on that
side; a twenty-line series is not, and those stay hand-written.

Three things here are not obvious, and each is a way an MLE goes quietly wrong.

**The Jacobian is deliberately absent.** The optimisation runs on the
unconstrained scale, through
:meth:`~hawkes_package.inference.parameters.ParameterSpec.to_constrained`, and
the log-determinant of that transform is *not* added. Adding it would be natural
-- the sampler does it -- and would silently return the mode of a density under a
flat prior on the unconstrained scale, which is a different estimator wearing the
same name.

**An unconstrained maximiser has no prior to protect it from a bad compensator.**
Every unit of :math:`\int\lambda` that goes missing is a penalty on a high
intensity that never gets applied, so the optimiser takes it: the background and
the excitation both come back large and the fit looks excellent. So the
compensator's resolution check is re-run **at the optimum**, where the integrand
is sharpest, and not only at the starting value.

**An inverse Hessian is not an interval.** At an optimum near the stationarity
boundary a differenced Hessian can come back indefinite, and the standard error
it reports is a plausible number with no content -- the same failure as a
collapsed particle cloud reading as confidence. :func:`profile_interval` walks
the likelihood instead.

    is the documented way this package has gone wrong before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    likelihood : LogLikelihood
        Any of the likelihoods, carrying the model whose parameters are fitted.
    history : History
        The data.
    start : array_like
        Starting parameters, on the model's own scale. Must lie inside the
        support: a start the process cannot be built at is refused here rather
        than becoming an ``inf`` the optimiser cannot escape from.
    method : str
        Passed to :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`. The default is
        ``"Nelder-Mead"`` on purpose. The objective is ``inf`` outside the
        support, and a gradient-based method differencing across that boundary
        takes a step nobody can interpret, where a simplex reflects away from it.
    max_iterations : int, optional
        Iteration cap. ``None`` leaves the method's own default.
    tol : float, optional
        Passed through as the method's tolerance.
    recheck_resolution : bool
        Re-run the compensator's order-``P``-versus-``2P`` check at the optimum.
        Defaults to ``True``, and the reason is in the module docstring: an
        unconstrained maximiser has no prior to protect it from an
        under-integrated compensator, which rewards exactly the parameters it
        should penalise.

    Returns
    -------
    MaximumLikelihoodFit

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `start` lies outside the model's support.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If the optimiser reports that it did not converge. Returning the last
        iterate silently is how a failed fit gets published, and the suite runs
        with ``filterwarnings = ["error"]`` so that a downstream test sees it.

    **Not an inverse Hessian**, and that is the point. A numerically differenced

    asymmetric, which near a boundary it always is.

    level : float
        One of 0.90, 0.95 or 0.99.
    span : float
        How far to search, as a multiple of the estimate. **A returned endpoint
        at the search boundary means the data did not bound this coordinate**,
        which is information rather than a failure -- for an exponential kernel
        it is the ordinary state of ``alpha``, whose lower profile at 400 events
        drops only 0.85 by the time ``alpha`` has fallen a hundredfold, because
        ``beta`` follows it down and the branching ratio is what the data
        actually pins.

    **Give it to `proposal=`, never to `prior=`, and the distinction is not
    pedantry.** As a proposal it is corrected for by weight and the posterior is

    the maximum pulls the answer to the maximum. Measured on 300 events at
    ``width=0.5``: used as a proposal, the four-block posterior mean stays the
    vague prior's ``(0.95, 0.21, 1.52)`` and the log evidence agrees to within
    Monte Carlo error; used as a prior, the mean moves to ``(1.07, 0.30, 2.39)``

    `SMCDiagnostics` with no cloud behind it -- and those diagnostics exist to be
    read. A user who wants a posterior should reach for a class that has one.

    What this deliberately does **not** have: `partial_fit`, because a maximum
    is not something you extend by a block; `sample_posterior`, because there is
    no posterior; and `predict_intensity_band`, because a point estimate has no
    band. `profile_interval_` is the honest replacement for the last of those,
    one coordinate at a time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : ProcessModel or str
        As for :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.estimator.HawkesEstimator`.
    start : array_like
        Starting parameters, on the model's own scale. Required: an optimiser
        needs somewhere to begin, and a default here would be a modelling
        assumption dressed as a convenience.
    likelihood : LogLikelihood, optional
        Defaults to the fastest one exact for the model.
    method : str
        Passed to :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`; see :func:`fit_mle`.
    max_iterations : int, optional
        Iteration cap.
    recheck_resolution : bool
        Re-run the compensator's resolution check at the optimum.

    Attributes
    ----------
    theta_ : numpy.ndarray
        The estimate, once fitted.
    fit_ : MaximumLikelihoodFit
        The whole result, including whether the optimiser converged.
    model_, likelihood_, history_
        As for :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.estimator.HawkesEstimator`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import hawkes_package as hp
    >>> from hawkes_package.inference import History, HawkesMLE
    >>> process = hp.ExponentialHawkes(np.array([1.0, 0.5, 2.0]), rng=0)
    >>> process.simulate(300)
    >>> estimator = HawkesMLE("exponential", start=[1.0, 0.3, 1.0])
    >>> estimator.fit(History.from_simulation(process)).theta_.shape
    (3,)
