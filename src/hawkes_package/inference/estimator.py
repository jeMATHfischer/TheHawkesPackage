r"""A scikit-learn-shaped front door to the sequential Monte Carlo fit.

One object where :mod:`~hawkes_package.inference` otherwise asks for four -- a
model, a prior, a likelihood and a sampler -- behind the method names a user of
scikit-learn already knows. **Nothing new is inferred here.** :meth:`fit` builds
an :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.SMCSampler` and runs it,
:meth:`partial_fit` calls
:meth:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.SMCSampler.update`, and every forecast and
diagnostic is the existing function with the fitted objects already filled in.
Two exact equalities say so, and are tested: a fit is
:func:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.fit_smc` bit-for-bit at the same seed, and a
`partial_fit` per block is ``fit(blocks=k)`` bit-for-bit.

scikit-learn is not a dependency and is not imported at module scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------

``clone``, ``Pipeline`` and ``GridSearchCV`` reach an estimator through
``get_params``/``set_params`` and never through ``isinstance`` -- ``clone``'s own
gate is ``hasattr(estimator, "get_params")`` -- so inheriting
:class:`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` buys no behaviour. It costs some: a base
class chosen by whichever packages happen to be installed makes ``repr``,
parameter ordering and pickling differ between environments, which is the class
of difference this package exists not to ship silently. It is also impossible
under ``mypy --strict``, because scikit-learn ships no ``py.typed``: the base is
``Any`` and ``disallow_subclassing_any`` refuses it, installed or not.

So :class:`HawkesEstimator` reimplements the protocol in :class:`_ParamsMixin`,
and ``tests/inference/test_sklearn_interop.py`` pins that against
``BaseEstimator``'s own implementation -- which is what stops the two drifting.
A caller who genuinely needs the ``isinstance`` writes two lines::

    from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator


    class SklearnHawkes(BaseEstimator, HawkesEstimator): ...

Why nothing is validated in ``__init__``
----------------------------------------

``clone`` reconstructs an estimator as ``klass(**est.get_params())`` and then
asserts that every value is the *same object*. So ``int(n_particles)`` here would
break cloning for a NumPy integer rather than catch a mistake, and
``np.random.default_rng(rng)`` would break it always. The rule is therefore
absolute: **one assignment per parameter, in signature order, and nothing else.**

That is a smaller departure from this package's habits than it looks, because
almost none of the validation was ours to begin with:
:class:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.SMCSampler` already refuses
``n_particles < 2``, an ``ess_threshold`` outside ``(0, 1]``, a negative
``n_move``, an MCMC move under a drifting evolution, a non-positive ``scale`` and
an unknown ``on_invalid``, with better messages than a second copy would carry;
:class:`~hawkes_package.inference.models.ProcessModel`,
:class:`~hawkes_package.inference.likelihood.History` and
``priors.spec_for`` cover the rest. :meth:`HawkesEstimator.fit` builds the
sampler **before it touches the data**, so those errors still arrive on the first
statement of the fit rather than after a minute of quadrature.

class HawkesEstimator(_ParamsMixin):
    """Fit a Hawkes process to observed events, and predict its intensity.

    A wrapper over :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.SMCSampler` with the
    scikit-learn method names. The sampler is a particle filter over the
    data-tempered posterior, so :meth:`partial_fit` is not a convenience bolted
    on afterwards -- it is the algorithm's own entry point, and the reason this
    class is worth having.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : ProcessModel or str
        The parameterised family to fit. A string names one of the temporal
        factories -- ``"exponential"``, ``"monotone"`` or ``"bell_shape"``.
        Spatio-temporal models must be passed as objects, from
        :func:`~hawkes_package.inference.models.spatio_temporal_model`, so the
        domain is visible where the fit is written.
    prior : Prior
        Where you think the truth might be. **No default**, deliberately: a
        default prior is a silent modelling choice of the same kind
        :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.likelihood.History` refuses for its
        window, and its dimension depends on the model. The usual form is
        ``ConstrainedPrior(IndependentPrior(marginals), model.support)``; an
        untruncated prior is not wrapped for you, because
        :meth:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.SMCSampler.initialise` already
        refuses it with a message naming the offending draw, its branching ratio
        and the wrapper to apply.
    likelihood : LogLikelihood, optional
        Defaults to the fastest implementation that is exact for `model`:
        :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.likelihood.ExponentialLogLikelihood`
        for the exponential family,
        :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.likelihood.SpatioTemporalLogLikelihood`
        for a spatial one,
        :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.likelihood.TemporalLogLikelihood`
        otherwise. This is a speed choice and not a modelling one -- the two
        temporal paths compute the same number, at ``O(n)`` against ``O(n^2 P)``.
        The one thing it cannot guess is ``extra_lags`` for a kernel with an
        interior kink; pass the likelihood yourself for that, and note that
        ``TemporalLogLikelihood`` warns on the first evaluation when its
        quadrature is under-resolved.

        A likelihood passed here is **reused across fits**, and carries state --
        a geometry cache, a resolved backend. Fitting one instance to two
        different histories therefore raises, rather than answering from the
        wrong cache.
    n_particles : int
        Cloud size. What a small cloud gets wrong is the posterior's *width*,
        not its centre.
    blocks : int or sequence of float
        How :meth:`fit` splits the history. **Eight, not**
        :func:`~hawkes_package.inference.smc.fit_smc`'s **one**: a single block
        is IBIS with one tempering step, which is importance sampling from the
        prior, and it degenerates on any history long enough to be worth
        fitting.
    evolution : Evolution, optional
        Defaults to :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.evolution.Static`, the
        exact IBIS sampler. Anything else makes this a filter over a drifting
        parameter and requires ``n_move=0``.
    ess_threshold : float
        Resample when the effective sample size falls below this fraction.
    n_move : int
        Metropolis steps per particle after a resample.
    scale : float
        Multiplier on the optimal random-walk scaling.
    jitter : float
        Relative ridge on the proposal covariance before factorising.
    resampler : callable
        :func:`~hawkes_package.inference.resample.systematic` by default.
    on_invalid : {"raise", "reject"}
        What to do when a particle's likelihood cannot be evaluated.
    rng : None, int or numpy.random.Generator
        Source of randomness. Named `rng` rather than scikit-learn's
        ``random_state`` because ``check_random_state`` returns a legacy
        ``RandomState``, which this package never constructs -- accepting a
        ``Generator`` under that name would be a false promise. Nothing in
        ``clone`` or ``get_params`` keys on the name.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model_ : ProcessModel
        The resolved model. Present only after a fit.
    likelihood_ : LogLikelihood
        The resolved or auto-selected likelihood.
    sampler_ : SMCSampler
        The live sampler. This is what :meth:`partial_fit` continues.
    history_ : History
        The cumulative history fitted so far, window included.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> est = HawkesEstimator("exponential", prior, n_particles=128, rng=0)
    >>> est.fit(times, end=100.0).theta_.shape
    (3,)
    >>> est.diagnostics_.warnings()  # an empty list is the health check
    []

    Notes
    -----
    What this is not: it is not a :class:`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` subclass
    (see the module docstring), it does not pass ``check_estimator``, and it
    cannot be used with ``GridSearchCV`` or ``cross_val_score`` -- not for a
    technical reason but a statistical one, since a point-process history cannot
    be sliced into folds when every fold's likelihood depends on the events
    before it. Sweep parameters with an explicit loop over ``clone``,
    :meth:`set_params`, :meth:`fit` and a chronological :meth:`score` instead.

            :meth:`forecast`, :meth:`predict_counts` or :meth:`predict_interval`,
            which answer that question by simulating forward.

            Also if the fitted model is spatio-temporal, where a temporal
            intensity is not defined without a location.

        Notes
        -----
        At an observed event time this is the **left limit**
        :math:`\lambda(t^-)`: the intensity hook filters ``t_j < t`` strictly,
        which is the same convention the log-likelihood's sum uses. So at a fixed
        parameter, ``predict(history_.times)`` is exactly the vector the
        log-likelihood takes logs of.

        Cost is ``n_particles`` process builds and ``n_particles * k`` intensity
        evaluations, each linear in the number of events. Vectorising across
        particles would need a second expression for the intensity, which is the
        one thing this package does not do; the knob is ``n_particles``.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            A total, not a per-event average. Dividing by the event count would
            divide by a *random* quantity the model itself predicts, which
            destroys properness: a model forecasting fewer events would score
            better for nothing.

        Notes
        -----
        The scored window must **abut** the fitted one, because the process has
        memory: the intensity on ``(T, T']`` depends on every event before ``T``,
        so a segment scored as though it began fresh is not the same quantity.
        The conditioning history is always ``history_``, and a gap is refused --
        the compensator over unobserved time can be neither included nor left
        out.

        Nothing is mutated: no sampler is built, no particle state advances and
        ``history_`` is untouched. On a spatio-temporal fit the likelihood's
        geometry cache does grow to cover the scored window, which is what makes
        the intended score-then-absorb sequence cheap.
