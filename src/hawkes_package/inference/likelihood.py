r"""The Hawkes log-likelihood, computed from the simulator's own intensity hooks.

For a **fully observed** Hawkes process there is no latent state: the intensity
is a deterministic function of the events that have already happened. So the
log-likelihood on ``[start, T]`` is available in closed form up to one integral,

.. math::

    \ell(\theta) = \sum_{t_i \le T} \log \lambda_\theta(t_i^- \mid H)
                   - \int_{start}^{T} \lambda_\theta(s)\,\mathrm{d}s,

and in the spatio-temporal case the same with
:math:`\log\lambda_\theta(t_i^-, x_i)` in the sum and
:math:`\int\!\!\int_D \lambda_\theta` in the integral.

Three things about that formula decide the design of this module.

**The left limit is not an aside.** The sum uses :math:`\lambda(t_i^-)`, the
intensity *just before* the event, excluding the event itself. Every intensity
hook in this package already filters ``t_j < t`` strictly, which is why
:func:`_bind_history` can assign the whole observed array at once and get both
terms right in one shot -- and also why tied event times are refused: two events
at the same instant would each be excluded from the other's intensity, and one
:math:`\log\lambda` contribution would quietly go missing.

**The observation window is data.** ``History.end`` has no default. Defaulting
it to the last event time silently switches the model between "observed on
``[0, T]``" and "stopped at the n-th event", and the two differ by
:math:`-\int_{t_n}^{T}\lambda` -- which is the information that *nothing
happened* after the last event. Dropping it biases ``mu`` and the excitation
upward, and nothing raises.

**The integral is where the bias lives.** A compensator computed too small
subtracts too little from the penalty on a high intensity, so the fit comes back
with more background and more excitation than the data supports and looks
converged doing it. Everything in :mod:`~hawkes_package.inference._compensator`
exists for that one failure mode.

class History:
    """An observed realisation, together with the window it was observed on.

    Parameters
    ----------
    times : array_like of shape (n,)
        Event times, strictly increasing and strictly inside ``(start, end]``.
    points : array_like of shape (ndim, n), optional
        Event locations, in the same layout as
        :attr:`~hawkes_package.SpatioTemporalHawkesProcess.events` minus its
        time row. ``None`` for a temporal history.
    start : float
        Beginning of the observation window.
    end : float
        End of the observation window. **Keyword-required and undefaulted**;
        see the module docstring for what a default would cost.
    types : array_like of shape (n,), optional
        Event type per event, for a multivariate history. ``None`` for a
        single-type one.

        .. versionadded:: 0.6.0
    n_types : int, optional
        How many types the model has. **Required whenever `types` is given, and
        never inferred from** ``types.max() + 1``: a type that happens to
        produce no event in this window would then vanish from the model, its
        background and its column of the excitation matrix silently dropped,
        and the fit would come back converged on a smaller process than the one
        asked for. Undefaulted for the same reason `end` is.

        .. versionadded:: 0.6.0
    marks : array_like of shape (n,), optional
        A continuous mark per event, scaling its productivity. Unlike `types`
        this carries no companion count: a mark is a real number and there is
        nothing about the mark *law* the history can be asked to declare.

        .. versionadded:: 0.8.0

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the times are not strictly increasing, are not finite, or leave the
        window. Ties in particular: two events at one instant each vanish from
        the other's conditional intensity, so the log-likelihood loses a term
        with nothing said. Also if exactly one of `types` and `n_types` is
        given, or if a type falls outside ``[0, n_types)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> history = History(np.array([0.4, 1.1, 2.9]), None, 0.0, end=4.0)
    >>> history.upto(1.5).times

    The normative implementation for the temporal classes: it evaluates

    -- and integrates it by panelled Gauss-Legendre. Nothing about the intensity
    is re-derived here, which is the point. A second, faster expression for
    :math:`\lambda` is how this package once came to plot a curve a constant
    ``mu`` below the one it simulated, and a second expression used by the
    *likelihood* would be the same mistake somewhere it cannot be seen.

    Costs :math:`O(n^2 P)` for a full evaluation, ``P`` being the panel order:
    each of the ``n`` panels carries ``P`` nodes and each node sums over up to
    ``n`` past events. At ``n = 2000`` that is a few hundred milliseconds per
    particle, so a rejuvenation move over 512 particles is minutes rather than
    seconds -- size a general-kernel fit at a few hundred events, or use
    :class:`ExponentialLogLikelihood`, which is :math:`O(n)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : ProcessModel
        Must be a temporal model.
    order : int

    extra_lags : sequence of float
        Lags at which the kernel has an interior kink, so a panel edge is placed
        there. A triangular kernel peaking at lag 0.5 needs ``(0.5,)``; without
        it the rule integrates across the kink and the compensator carries an
        error with a consistent sign.
    check : bool
        Compare order ``P`` against ``2P`` on the first full evaluation and warn
        if they disagree. Once per object, not once per particle.

    Two terms, and the second is the one worth arguing about:

    .. math::

        \ell(\theta) = \underbrace{\sum_i \log\lambda(t_i^-) - \int\lambda}_{\text{the process}}
                     + \underbrace{\sum_i \log f(m_i)}_{\text{the marks}}.

    For marks drawn independently of the history the second term does not depend
    on ``mu``, ``alpha``, ``beta`` or ``scale`` at all, so an optimiser over those
    four may drop it as a constant. It is included **by default** anyway, for two
    reasons.

    ``b_value`` is the first. It appears in the mark density and nowhere else in
    the likelihood -- its only other appearance is in the *support*, as the
    stationarity boundary ``scale < b_value``. Drop the mark term and the
    parameter is identified by a constraint rather than by data, and the
    posterior for it is the prior truncated at a line.

    The second is comparison. A log evidence or a Bayes factor that silently
    omitted the marks would be comparing models on part of the data, and the part
    omitted is the part a mark law is *for*.

    extra_lags : sequence of float

    check : bool
        Compare order ``P`` against ``2P`` once and warn if they disagree.
    include_mark_density : bool
        Whether to add the mark term. ``False`` is for an optimiser that holds
        ``b_value`` fixed and wants the constant out of the way; it is not a
        cheaper way to get the same answer.

class MultivariateLogLikelihood:
    r"""The log-likelihood of a multivariate Hawkes process, from its own hooks.

    The same formula as :class:`TemporalLogLikelihood` with one change, and the
    change is the whole point:

    .. math::

        \ell(\theta) = \sum_{t_i \le T} \log \lambda_{c_i}(t_i^-)
                       - \int_{start}^{T} \sum_i \lambda_i(s)\,\mathrm{d}s.

    The **sum** runs over the intensity of the type each event actually carries;
    the **integral** runs over the total across types, because that is the rate
    at which events of any type arrive. Using the total in both places is the
    mistake this class exists to make impossible, and it is why
    :class:`TemporalLogLikelihood` refuses a multivariate model rather than
    accepting one and reading its scalar hook: the compensator would be right,
    the log-sum wrong by :math:`\log(\Lambda / \lambda_{c_i})` per event -- a
    strictly positive amount at every event -- and the excitation would come
    back systematically large on a fit that looked converged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : ProcessModel
        A model whose components are
        :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.models.MultivariateComponents`.

        shape except a power law -- see
        :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.families.OmoriUtsuKernel`.
    extra_lags : sequence of float
        Extra breakpoints per event, for a kernel with a kink away from zero.
    check : bool
        Compare order ``P`` against ``2P`` once and warn if they disagree.

                     \sum_{t_i \le T}\left(1 - e^{-\beta(T - t_i)}\right),

    and Ozaki's recursion turns the log-sum into one pass as well. Writing
    :math:`B(a) = \sum_{t_i \le a} e^{-\beta(a - t_i)}`, an event at :math:`t`
    has :math:`\lambda(t^-) = \mu + \alpha B(t^-)`, and :math:`B` advances by a
    single multiplication per step. So a full evaluation is :math:`O(n)` and an
    incremental one is :math:`O(\text{new events})` -- against :math:`O(n^2 P)`
    and :math:`O(nP)` for the general path.

    Scalar Python arithmetic rather than NumPy, deliberately: the recursion is
    sequential, so a vectorized version would be a loop over ``n`` one-element
    array operations, and array dispatch costs more per step than the

class MultivariateExponentialLogLikelihood:
    r"""The exact log-likelihood of the linear multivariate exponential model.

    Ozaki's recursion generalises to a matrix at a cost of ``d`` floats rather
    than ``d**2``, and that is a direct consequence of the one shared decay
    rate. Writing :math:`B_j(a) = \sum_{t_k \le a,\, c_k = j} e^{-\beta(a-t_k)}`,
    every component reads the *same* ``d`` numbers:

    .. math::

        \lambda_i(t^-) = \mu_i + \sum_j A_{ij} B_j(t^-),

    and every :math:`B_j` advances by the same single multiplication per step.
    So one full evaluation is :math:`O(n d)` -- not :math:`O(n d^2)`, because
    the carry is indexed by *source* type only -- against :math:`O(n^2 P)` for
    the general path. Per-pair decay rates would break this: the carry would
    need one entry per ordered pair and the recursion would cost :math:`d^2`.

    The compensator collapses further. The total intensity is

    .. math::

        \Lambda(s) = \sum_i \mu_i + \sum_j \Big(\sum_i A_{ij}\Big) B_j(s),

    so only the **column sums** of the matrix enter it, and the integral is one
    weighted decay term per source type.

class SpatioTemporalLogLikelihood:
    r"""The log-likelihood of a spatio-temporal model, by hooks or by cached geometry.

    Two backends compute the same number, and which one ran is always recorded.

    ``backend="hooks"`` is the **normative** definition: it builds the process,
    conditions it on the history and calls ``_full_intensity`` and
    ``_integrated_intensity`` -- what the simulator thins against, floor and
    all. It is also unusably slow for a fit. One space integral costs 114 ms on
    a ``Circle`` at 256 nodes and 50 events, so a single log-likelihood at
    n = 200 is about twelve minutes, and a fit is a thousand of those.

    ``backend="cached"`` is the same quantity rearranged around the separability
    of the intensity. Because :math:`\lambda(t, x) = \mu(x) + \sum_i
    \kappa_t(t - t_i)\kappa_s(d(x, x_i))` is a sum, the space integral
    distributes:

    .. math::

        \int_D \lambda(t, x)\,\mathrm{d}x = \int_D \mu
            + \sum_{t_i < t} \kappa_t(t - t_i)\, S_i, \qquad
        S_i = \int_D \kappa_s(d(x, x_i))\,\mathrm{d}x,

    and every :math:`S_i` is a fixed quadrature sum over distances that do not
    depend on ``theta``. Same answer, three milliseconds instead of twelve
    minutes.

    **The rearrangement has a precondition, and it is checked rather than
    assumed.** The process floors the intensity *after* summing --
    ``max(0, mu(x) + sum)`` -- so the identity above holds only where the
    pre-floor integrand is non-negative at every node. Where it is not, the
    cached form over-counts the negative region and the compensator comes out
    too small, which biases the excitation upward: the one direction of error
    this whole module is arranged to prevent. So the cached backend verifies
    that the background and the spatial kernel are non-negative wherever it
    evaluates them, and **raises** rather than degrading. ``backend="auto"``
    falls back to the hooks once, with a warning, and then stays there.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : ProcessModel
        Must be a spatio-temporal model.
    order : int
        Gauss-Legendre nodes per panel for the time integral.
    backend : {"auto", "cached", "hooks"}
        Which path to use.
    homogeneous : {"auto", True, False}
        Whether to treat every :math:`S_i` as equal. On a homogeneous domain it
        is true to rounding -- the relative spread is 1.4e-16 on a ``Circle`` --
        and the saving is real, because the spatial kernel then has to be
        evaluated at a handful of events' distances rather than all of them. On
        a domain that is a proper subset of its bounding box the spread is not
        zero but the quadrature error, 1.25e-4 on a hexagon at 32 nodes per
        axis, which makes :attr:`spatial_spread` a free accuracy diagnostic
        rather than only a switch.
    geometry : GeometryCache, optional
        A cache to reuse. Built on first use otherwise, and extended in place as
        the history grows.
    rtol : float
        Relative spread above which ``homogeneous="auto"`` declines to use a
        single :math:`\bar{S}`, and warns.
    extra_lags : sequence of float
        As for :class:`TemporalLogLikelihood`.
    max_cache_bytes : int
        Ceiling on the distance tensors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    backend_used : str
        ``"cached"`` or ``"hooks"``, set on the first evaluation.
    homogeneous_used : bool
        Whether a single :math:`\bar{S}` was used.
    spatial_spread : float
        The measured relative spread of :math:`S_i`, or ``nan`` before the first
        evaluation.
