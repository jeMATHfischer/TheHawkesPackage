r"""Residuals on a partition of the observation window.

Time rescaling answers "did the events arrive at the right *rate*". It cannot
answer "did they arrive in the right *places*", because it collapses space
before it starts -- so a model that puts the right number of events on the wrong
side of the domain passes it cleanly.

Cell residuals answer both at once. Partition the window into cells :math:`C`
and compare what was observed against what was predicted:

.. math::

    R(C) = N(C) - \int_C \lambda, \qquad
    R^{*}(C) = \frac{R(C)}{\sqrt{\int_C \lambda}}.

Under the true model :math:`N(C)` is Poisson with mean :math:`\int_C \lambda`, so
:math:`R^{*}` is approximately standard normal wherever that mean is not tiny --
which is the whole caveat, and why cells below a floor are excluded rather than
reported. Standardising by a near-zero expectation turns one stray event into a
residual of forty and buries every real signal beside it.

The integrals come from :func:`independent_compensator`, not from the
likelihood's own quadrature. That is the point of the subpackage: see its module
docstring for the cancellation it exists to avoid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    likelihood : LogLikelihood
        Supplies the model. Its own compensator is **not** used unless
        `compensator` says so.
    theta : array_like
        A single parameter vector.
    history : History
        The observed events.
    n_cells : int
        Number of equal-width cells spanning ``[start, end]``.
    compensator : callable, optional
        Override the integrator, taking ``(theta, history, times)``. Pass
        ``likelihood.compensator`` to reproduce the shared-arithmetic behaviour
        deliberately -- which is what the guard test does, to show the two
        differ.

    Returns
    -------
    CellResiduals

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `n_cells` is not positive.

    Notes
    -----
    Equal-width cells rather than equal-count ones. Equal counts would put the
    boundaries where the events are, which makes every cell's observed count the
    same by construction and hides exactly the clustering a Hawkes model is for.
