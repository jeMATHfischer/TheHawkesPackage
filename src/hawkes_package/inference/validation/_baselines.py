r"""What a fitted model has to beat before it has shown anything.

A goodness-of-fit test says the model is *not obviously wrong*. It does not say
the model is worth having. A Hawkes fit that passes every residual check and
predicts no better than a constant rate has found nothing, and nothing in the
existing diagnostics would say so.

The bar is the **homogeneous Poisson process at its own maximum likelihood**,
:math:`\hat\nu = n / T`. Not a Poisson process at some convenient rate: the best
constant-rate model there is, so that beating it cannot be an artefact of having
handed the baseline a bad parameter. Its log-likelihood has a closed form,

.. math::

    \ell_0 = n \log \hat\nu - \hat\nu T = n \log(n / T) - n,

with :math:`T` the window length -- or the window length times the domain
measure for a spatio-temporal model, since there the intensity is a density per
unit area as well as per unit time and the two log-likelihoods are otherwise not
comparable.

**A baseline that is too weak is worse than none**, because beating it reads as
evidence. That is why the rate is the MLE and not the fitted background: a
constant rate fixed at the fitted ``mu`` is *guaranteed* to lose, since ``mu``
sits below the observed rate precisely because the excitation accounts for the
rest. Reporting a win against that would be reporting arithmetic.
