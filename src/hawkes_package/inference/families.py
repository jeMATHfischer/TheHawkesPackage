"""Parameterised kernels, backgrounds and nonlinearities.

The simulation side takes plain callables: a kernel is whatever function the
caller hands it. Inference needs more than a callable, because it has to build
one *per particle, per move* and then say things about it in closed form. A
family is that extra structure -- a :class:`ParameterSpec`, a builder, and two
summaries the sampler cannot afford to compute numerically:

* :meth:`~KernelFamily.peak`, because
  :class:`~hawkes_package.bell_shape.BellShapeHawkes` and the non-monotone
  spatio-temporal path locate the kernel's maximum at construction with
  :func:`~hawkes_package._numerics.locate_peak`, a 513-point scan with a bounded
  refinement. That is the right thing to do for a kernel nobody can
  differentiate, and the wrong thing to do 512 times per rejuvenation move for a
  kernel whose maximum is one line of algebra. Every family here returns the
  algebra, and the tests check it against the scan.
* :meth:`~KernelFamily.mass`, the integral over all lags, because the branching
  ratio decides whether a parameter is one the process can be *simulated* at.
  Guessing it wrong does not raise: the particle survives, the likelihood on a
  finite window is finite, and only the excitation estimate is wrong.

    an approximation of one -- and it is what makes neighbour skipping **exact**:
    dropping a pair separated by more than `R` is not truncating the sum, it is

    It is **not** strictly positive, so it cannot be used with the cached
    spatio-temporal backend's separability shortcut wherever the pre-floor
    integrand would go negative -- that backend raises rather than degrading, and
    a kernel that is zero over most of a large domain is the most likely thing to

    .. math::

        \mu(x) = \exp\!\left(\beta_0 + \sum_k \beta_k\, z_k(x)\right),

    **per unit measure**, the same convention :class:`ConstantBase` states: the
    background event rate is the integral of this over the domain, not the value
    times anything. Two backgrounds are comparable only if both mean that.

    The link is logarithmic rather than affine so the value is **positive
    everywhere by construction**. That is not cosmetic: the cached
    spatio-temporal backend's separability identity holds only where the
    pre-floor integrand is non-negative at every quadrature node, and it raises
    rather than degrading when it is not. An affine background with a covariate
    coefficient of the wrong sign trips that on a fit that is otherwise going
    fine; this one cannot.

    With no covariates at all it is a constant background in an unusual
    parameterisation, which is a useful thing to have: it is what the tests
    compare against :class:`ConstantBase` to show the plumbing carries a varying
    background without changing any number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    covariates : sequence of callable
        Each takes an ``(m, ndim)`` array of positions and returns ``(m,)``
        values. **Vectorized**, because these are evaluated at every quadrature
        node for every particle of every rejuvenation move. Non-finite values
        are refused where they appear, naming the covariate: a ``nan`` covariate
        otherwise turns the whole log-likelihood into ``nan``, which the sampler
        reads as an invalid particle and quietly resamples away.
    names : sequence of str, optional
        Names for the coefficients, used in the parameter names and so in every
        diagnostic. Defaults to positional ``b_0``, ``b_1``, ...

    Notes
    -----
    Nothing is centred or standardised for you. A covariate with a large mean
    trades off against ``log_mu0`` almost exactly, and a pair of parameters that
    trade off exactly is a ridge the posterior never leaves -- the same failure
    :class:`SoftPlusNonlinearity` avoids by not fitting its scale. Centre the
    covariate if the marginal for ``log_mu0`` comes back wide and correlated.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> east = lambda points: np.asarray(points, dtype=float)[:, 0]
    >>> base = LogLinearBase((east,), names=("east",))
    >>> base.spec.names
    ('log_mu0', 'b_east')

class PeriodicBase:
    r"""A background whose rate repeats: :math:`\mu(t, x) = m(x)\,s(t)`.

    Wraps another :class:`BaseFamily` -- the *shape* -- and adds a truncated
    Fourier schedule on a declared period. Its coordinates are the shape's,
    followed by ``(a_1, b_1, ..., a_K, b_K)`` on the whole real line.

    **Separable on purpose.** The compensator then factorises into the spatial
    integral the package already computes and the schedule's own closed form,
    instead of a two-dimensional quadrature. A background whose spatial *shape*
    changes with the hour is a joint model and is out of scope.

    **Zero coefficients are the constant background**, exactly: the schedule is
    then 1 at every time and its integral is the interval length, so a fit with
    the amplitudes pinned at zero is the fit that predates this class. That is
    what makes "is there a cycle at all" a question about a parameter rather
    than a comparison of two models.

    The confounding this exists to resolve is worth naming: a daily cycle and
    self-excitation both produce clustering, and a fit that finds plausible
    amounts of each may have split them anywhere along a ridge. The evidence
    that they are separable at all is a recovery test with each effect switched
    off in turn, not the model's own report.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : BaseFamily
        The spatial background, per unit measure.
    n_harmonics : int
        How many ``(cos, sin)`` pairs. One is a single daily cycle; more buy
        shape at the cost of a rougher integrand, and the compensator's
        resolution check is what says when that has gone too far.
    period : float
        The cycle length, **declared and not fitted**. A fitted period is
        multimodal -- every integer fraction of the truth is a local maximum --
        and applied users have a period they know.
