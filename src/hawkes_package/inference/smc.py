r"""Sequential Monte Carlo over the parameters, with resample-move rejuvenation.

The algorithm is Chopin's **IBIS**: an SMC sampler over the data-tempered
sequence :math:`\pi_k(\theta) \propto p(\theta)\exp\ell_k(\theta)`, where
:math:`\ell_k` is the log-likelihood of the first ``k`` blocks. Particles carry
parameters, not states; a block of data arrives, every particle's log weight
gains that block's log-likelihood increment, and when the weights have
concentrated the cloud is resampled and moved.

**Why not a bootstrap filter.** For a fully observed Hawkes process the
parameter is *static*: there is no transition to propagate through. A bootstrap
filter over a static parameter degenerates, and it does so quietly. With no
transition noise the cloud can never regain diversity -- resampling only ever
deletes particles -- so after a few hundred observations the posterior is a
single point carrying weight one. It has zero variance, so every credible
interval it reports is empty, and its location is wherever the noise happened
to leave it. Nothing about the output says any of that happened, which is why
:class:`SMCDiagnostics` records the effective sample size and the number of
distinct particles at every step rather than only at the end.

**Rejuvenation is what fixes it** (Gilks and Berzuini's resample-move). After
resampling, each particle takes a few Metropolis-Hastings steps targeting the
current posterior. The move is invariant for :math:`\pi_k`, so it changes the
particles without changing what they represent -- but only while
:math:`\pi_k` *is* a fixed target. Under a drifting parameter there is no such
target, so :class:`SMCSampler` refuses that combination at construction rather
than producing plausible output aimed at nothing.

class SMCSampler:
    """Fit a Hawkes model by sequential Monte Carlo, in blocks as data arrives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    likelihood : LogLikelihood
        Any of the three implementations in
        :mod:`~hawkes_package.inference.likelihood`.
    prior : Prior
        Must draw as many coordinates as the model has; checked at construction,
        because a prior one coordinate short broadcasts into a plausible array
        rather than failing.
    n_particles : int
        Cloud size. The posterior's *width* is what a small cloud gets wrong,
        not its centre, so a run that looks converged at 64 particles may still
        be reporting intervals half the size they should be.
    evolution : Evolution, optional
        Defaults to :class:`~hawkes_package.inference.evolution.Static`, which
        is the exact IBIS sampler. Anything else makes this a filter over a
        drifting parameter, with the approximation
        :mod:`~hawkes_package.inference.evolution` describes.
    ess_threshold : float
        Resample when the effective sample size falls below this fraction of the
        cloud.
    n_move : int
        Metropolis steps per particle after a resample. **Must be zero for a
        non-static evolution**, and the constructor raises otherwise: an
        invariant kernel targeting a posterior the model says no longer exists
        is incoherent, and it is exactly the configuration reached by tuning
        until the output looks plausible.
    scale : float
        Multiplier on the optimal random-walk scaling. The proposal covariance
        is ``(scale**2 / n_dim) * C`` with ``C`` the weighted covariance of the
        cloud before resampling; 2.38 is Roberts and Rosenthal's constant.
    jitter : float
        Relative ridge added to that covariance before factorising. The cloud
        that most needs a move is the one that has collapsed, and a collapsed
        cloud has a singular covariance -- so this is what stops the
        factorisation failing exactly when it is needed.
    resampler : callable
        :func:`~hawkes_package.inference.resample.systematic` by default.
    on_invalid : {"raise", "reject"}
        What to do when a particle's likelihood cannot be evaluated. Raising is
        the default on purpose: reading an exception as "zero posterior mass" is
        how a broadcasting typo in a user kernel becomes a confident posterior.
    rng : None, int or numpy.random.Generator
        Source of randomness. Never the global stream.
